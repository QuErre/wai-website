W3C’s task forces operate under specific working groups to support them with particular tasks for their deliverables.

[Accessibility Conformance Testing Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/conformance-testing/)
: The objective of the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force is to develop and maintain a repository of ACT Rules for WCAG 2 in order to promote a unified interpretation across different web accessibility test tools and methodologies.<br />(Supports the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/))

[Authoring Practices Guide Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/practices/)
: The objective of the Authoring Practices Guide (APG) Task Force is to develop the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide, which describes considerations that might not be evident to authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone, and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties.<br />(Supports the [ARIA Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/))

[Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/coga/)
: The objective of the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility (COGA) Task Force is to develop guidance and techniques for content authoring and user agent implementation in order to make web content accessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities.<br />(Supports the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/) and the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))

[Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/fast/)
: The objectives of the Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST) Task Force are to develop and maintain inventories of user and functional needs; best practices guidance describing the features that web technologies should provide to ensure accessible content can be created; and the self-assessment tool used by W3C working groups during W3C’s accessibility horizontal review process.<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/))

[Low Vision Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/low-vision-a11y-tf/)
: The objective of the Low Vision Accessibility (LV) Task Force is to address web accessibility issues that are specific to people with low vision through inputting into WCAG 2 techniques and understanding documents; inputting into WCAG 3; and developing additional low-vision guidance resources.<br />(Supports the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/))

[Maturity Model Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/maturity-model/)
: The objective of the Maturity Model (MM) Task Force is to provide an Accessibility Maturity Model (AMM) that guides organizations in developing the capability to buy, build or use internal and external digital assets, products and services that are accessible; and to track changes and trends in the accessibility of these over time.<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))


[Mobile Accessibility Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/matf/)
: The objectives of the Mobile Accessibility (Mobile A11y) Task Force are to produce resources for how to apply the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to mobile — including, but not limited to, native mobile apps; mobile web apps; mobile web content; and hybrid apps that use web components inside native mobile apps — and to make sure mobile apps are considered in new accessibility guidelines.<br />(Supports the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/))

[Portable Document Format Accessibility APIs Mapping Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/pdf-aam/)
: The objective of the Portable Document Format Accessibility Application Programming Interfaces Mapping (PDF-AAM) Task Force is to specify how user agents should map accessibility semantics within the Portable Document Format specification.<br />(Supports the [ARIA Working Group](/about/groups/ariawg/))

[Research Question Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/research-questions/)
: The objectives of the Research Questions (RQ) Task Force are to identify accessibility barriers and knowledge gaps in emerging and future web technologies; publish the research findings on those barriers and gaps; and support W3C’s horizontal reviews of web technologies as they mature and are normatively specified.<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))

[Spoken Presentation Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/pronunciation/)
: The objective of the Spoken Presentation (previously known as Pronunciation) Task Force is to develop normative specifications and best practice guidance on providing proper pronunciation for HTML content across different operating systems, so that words are pronounced correctly when using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis and users’ preferred assistive technologies.<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))

[WAI-Adapt Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/adapt/)
: The objective of the WAI-Adapt Task Force is to develop normative specifications and best practices guidance to support enhanced and personalized web content delivery that better meets the diverse requirements of people with disabilities — it does this by making fuller use of underused features already specified in HTML, and by proposing new markup elements and attributes, as needed.<br />(Supports the [APA Working Group](/about/groups/apawg/))

[WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2x-backlog/)
: The objectives of the WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force are to maintain up-to-date versions of the normative and informative materials associated with versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 (2.x) of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG); and to document considerations for WCAG 3.0 that cannot be readily addressed within the existing normative language of the WCAG 2.x specification.<br />(Supports the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/))

[WCAG2ICT Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2ict/)
: The objective of the WCAG2ICT Task Force is to develop documentation describing how WCAG 2.x and its principles, guidelines, and success criteria could apply to non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (ICT).<br />(Supports the [AG Working Group](/about/groups/agwg/))
